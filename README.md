# Frontmatter

**Frontmatter is the data layer between content and CMS.**

We build tools that turn developer-authored content (Astro, Markdown, YAML, etc.) into clean, structured, CMS-ready data — without adding runtime, servers, or lock-in.

Frontmatter exists because content workflows are broken:

- Developers write content in files
- Editors want structured fields
- CMS expect rigid schemas
- Static sites want build-time data

Frontmatter makes these worlds speak the same language.

## What we build
### Frontmatter Core

A build-time engine that:

- Reads `.astro`, `.md`, `.yaml`
- Extracts frontmatter and datasets
- Produces a typed **JSON IR (Intermediate Representation)**
- Feeds any CMS through adapters

No runtime.<br>
No API.<br>
No SaaS.<br>
No lock-in.<br>

Just data you own.

## Philosophy

We believe:

- Content should be **portable**
- Schemas should be **derived from real usage**
- Build-time is the safest place to do data modeling
- CMS should be **consumers**, not gatekeepers

Frontmatter is not a CMS.<br>
It is the **bridge** between real content and whatever CMS you choose.
